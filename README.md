Raspberry pico mycropython IMU sensor
## This is an experiment in AI use for engineering
I had been trying grok3 for a number of things, mostly research and finding it rather helpful. I've developed an interest in geology after moving to Arizona which grew into an interest in seizmic events and detection. The RaspberryShake (A very well designed geophone sensor based upon Raspberry PI. https://raspberryshake.org ) looked intreaging but more than I wanted to spend. Looked around and didn't find anything that met my percieved needs at this time and thought I'd see how far down the road I could get without having to invest too much time in a new micro controller and microphython and the hardware to add DIY sensor such as https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog/measuring-earthquakes and making use of AI as much as I could.
The code here is the direct output from grok. And it runs!
